# PyPore
Pypore is a python tool box for fast and accurate quality control, conversion and alignment of nanopore sequencing data, in their raw format (Fast5). We developed PyPore as a command-line tool composed by three modules (`seqstats`, `fastqgen` and `alignment`), each provided with a set of specific options. PyPore comes out with a nice interactive result representation function, based on the plotly library, in order to allow user to zoom and pan the result summary getting information related to a specific experimental point.
## Requirements
- [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/)
- OpenMPI
- python 2.7
  - biopython
  - mpi4py
  - numpy
  - h5py
  - h5py_cache
  - plotly
  - python_dateutil
  - ntpath
  - pysam
## Installation
---
#### Dependencies
Before proceeding with PyPore installation, check for HDF5 and OpenMPI dependencies.
1. In order to check if HDF5 library is already present, type:
   ```
   h5cc -showconfig
   ```
1. If you are on **OS X** system equipped with the [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) package manager, check the available packges list by typing:
    ```
    brew list
    ```
    * If missing, install HDF5 through the HomeBrew Science "tap":
    
       ```
       brew tap homebrew/science
       brew install hdf5
       ```
1. Alternatively, if you use a Python distribution, such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html), installation of HDF5 can be done (for all OS) on the command line via:
    ```
    conda install -c anaconda hdf5
    ```
1. For **Linux** or other Unix distributions the HDF5 library can be found in `libhdf5-dev` package. Make sure that you have the development headers, as they are usually not installed by default.
1. For **Windows** users the HDF5 library installer can be downloaded from [here](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain518.html).
1. In order to install the OpenMPI library, refer to the following manuals for [Mac](other_file.md), [Unix/Unix Like]() and [Windows]() respectively.

#### PyPore
1. Clone the PyPore repository:
    1. **Unix** or **OS X**
       ```
       git clone https://github.com/rsemeraro/PyPore
       ```
    2. **Windows**
       ```
       git clone --single-branch -b Windows https://github.com/rsemeraro/PyPore.git
       ```
1. Install as root:
    ```
    cd PyPore
    python setup.py install
    ```
## Usage
PyPore consists of the following three modules:
- #### seqstats
   Seqstats provides an interface to explore the information related to a dataset of Fast5 files and to, optionally, convert and gather them in FastQ data. The basic syntax is:
    ```
    python pypore seqstats -i Files/Folder -l sample_label
    ```
    By means of `--fastq` and `--threads_number` options, it is possible to activate the fastq generation and to use multiple process to speed up the analysis. 
    ```
    python pypore seqstats -i Files/Folder -l sample_label --threads_number 8 --fastq yes
    ```
    To see all options, type:
    ```
    python pypore seqstats -h
    ```
    **Interactive Summaries**
    Outputs generated by `seqstats` are:
